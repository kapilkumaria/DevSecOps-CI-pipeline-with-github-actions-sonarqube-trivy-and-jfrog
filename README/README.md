# CI Pipeline with Jenkins, SonarQube, and JFrog Artifactory

This project demonstrates how to set up and integrate a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, SonarQube, and JFrog Artifactory for software development and testing on AWS EC2 instances.

# Technologies Used

1. AWS EC2: Infrastructure hosting the CI/CD tools.
2. Ubuntu: OS used for instances.
3. Jenkins: Automation server for CI/CD pipeline.
4. SonarQube: Tool for code quality analysis.
5. JFrog Artifactory: Universal binary repository manager.
6. AWS Secrets Manager: Secure storage for sensitive credentials like JFrog Artifactory and SonarQube secret information.

# Project Overview

## Setup JFrog Artifactory and SonarQube on an EC2 Ubuntu instance (t2.large) - Single EC2

1.1 We will install and configure Jenkins, JFrog Artifactory and SonarQube on a single EC2 Ubuntu instance. The instance type used will be t2.large.

## Pipeline Integration

2.1 Integrate Jenkins with JFrog Artifactory, SonarQube and Trivy on the same instance for an end-to-end CI pipeline.

# Trivy Setup

## Installation of Trivy directly in the Jenkins pipeline instead of on the instance

Step 1: Install Trivy in Jenkins Pipeline

Trivy is an open-source vulnerability scanner that can be integrated into your Jenkins pipeline to scan JAR files. In this case, Trivy will be installed during the pipeline execution, making it reusable across environments without needing a pre-installed version.

   1.1 Add Trivy Installation Step [Jenkinsfile](../jenkins/Jenkinsfile.aws) to your Jenkins pipeline. 

   1.2 Trivy Scan of the JAR File

   After the Trivy installation, you can perform a vulnerability scan of the JAR file generated by the Maven build. The scan results can be output in JSON or SARIF format, depending on your integration needs.


# Jfrog Artifactory SetUp
## Steps to Set Up JFrog Artifactory on an EC2 Ubuntu Instance
## Prerequisites

> Ensure you have an Ubuntu EC2 instance running (t2.large is recommended for this setup).
    You should have SSH access to the instance.

## Installation Instructions

Step 1: SSH into the EC2 Instance

Step 2: Use the following command to SSH into your Ubuntu EC2 instance,

   ```
   ssh -i "your-key.pem" ubuntu@your-instance-public-ip

   # Allow inbound traffic port 22, 8081 and 8082 from your IP 
   ```
#### _Important Note on EC2 Configuration_

When setting up Jenkins on an EC2 instance, it is highly recommended to associate an **Elastic IP** with the instance. 

By default, the public IP of your EC2 instance changes every time the instance is stopped and started. If you don't use an Elastic IP, you'll need to update the Jenkins URL in **Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Configure System > Jenkins URL** every time, which can cause Jenkins to behave slowly or cause connectivity issues.

To avoid this, allocate an Elastic IP in AWS and associate it with your EC2 instance, ensuring that your Jenkins instance always remains accessible at the same IP address.


Step 3: Install Java

   * JFrog Artifactory requires Java to run. Use the following commands to install OpenJDK 11,

     ```
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre -y
     ```

Step 4: Download and Extract JFrog Artifactory

   * Download the latest version of JFrog Artifactory from the official release repository,

     ```
     sudo su
     
     wget https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/artifactory-pro/org/artifactory/pro/jfrog-artifactory-pro/7.55.14/jfrog-artifactory-pro-7.55.14-linux.tar.gz
     
     tar -xvzf jfrog-artifactory-pro-7.55.14-linux.tar.gz
     ```

Step 5: Navigate into the Extracted Directory

     ```
     cd artifactory-pro-7.55.14/
     cd app/bin/
     ```

Step 6: Install JFrog Artifactory as a Service
   
   * To install JFrog Artifactory as a service, run the installation script,
    
     ```
     ./installService.sh
     ```

Step 7: Install net-tools package:

   * Run the following command to install the missing net-tools package:

     ```
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt-get install net-tools
     ```

Step 8: Configure Firewall Rules

   * Ensure the necessary ports are open for JFrog Artifactory,

     ```
     ufw allow 8081
     ufw allow 8082
     ```
Step 9: Start and Check Artifactory Service

   * Start the Artifactory service using the systemctl command,
     
     ```
     systemctl start artifactory.service
     ```

Step 10: Access JFrog Artifactory

   * Start the Xray service:

     ```
     sudo systemctl start xray.service
     ```

Step 11: Access JFrog Artifactory

   * Once the service is up and running, JFrog Artifactory will be accessible via the following ports,

     ```
     8081: Artifactory
     8082: API Access

     # You can access the JFrog Artifactory UI by navigating to http://<server-ip>:8081.
     ```

# JFrog Artifactory UI Setup
After successfully installing and starting JFrog Artifactory, follow these steps to configure your local repository using the JFrog UI.

Step 1: Access JFrog Artifactory
 
   * Open your browser and navigate to the JFrog Artifactory UI,

   ```
   http://<server-ip>:8081

   # Log in using the default credentials or your configured admin account
   ```
    
Step 2: Create a Local Maven Repository

   * Once logged in, follow these steps to create a local repository for Maven artifacts:

    1.1 In the top menu, click on Administration.
    1.2 In the left sidebar, select Repositories.
    1.3 Click on Add Repository and choose Local Repository from the options.
    1.4 Select Maven as the Package Type.
    1.5 In the Repository Key field, enter an identifier or name for your repository (e.g., maven-local).
    1.6 Review any other configuration options you may want to adjust.
    1.7 Click Create to set up your local Maven repository.

Step 3: View Artifacts and Binaries
   
   * To view the artifacts and binaries uploaded to your repository:

    1.1 Go to the Application section in the JFrog UI.
    1.2 Navigate to Artifactory > Artifacts.
    1.3 Here, you'll be able to see all the artifacts and binaries stored in your newly created local Maven repository.

# SonarQube Setup

   * After setting up JFrog Artifactory, we will now install and configure SonarQube on the same EC2 instance to perform code quality analysis.

## Prerequisites

    1.1 Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 11 installed.
    1.2 A non-root user to run SonarQube, as Elasticsearch (used by SonarQube) cannot run with root privileges.

## Installation Steps

Step 1: Download SonarQube Community Edition

   * To install SonarQube, download the latest version from the official SonarSource website:

   ```
   cd /opt
   wget https://binaries.sonarsource.com/Distribution/sonarqube/sonarqube-x.x.zip

   # Replace x.x with the latest version available from the SonarQube download page.
   ```

Step 2: Extract the Package

   * Unzip the downloaded SonarQube package:

   ```
   unzip /opt/sonarqube-x.x.zip
   ```

Step 3: Change Ownership

   * Before starting the SonarQube service, change the ownership of the SonarQube directory to a non-root user (this user should be created if it doesnâ€™t exist):

   ```
   chown -R <sonar_user>:<sonar_user_group> /opt/sonarqube-x.x

   # Replace <sonar_user> and <sonar_user_group> with the actual user and group you will use to manage SonarQube.
   ```

Step 4: Modify Configuration (Optional)

   * If you need to modify default settings, such as database configuration or web port, edit the sonar.properties file:

   ```
   cd /opt/sonarqube-x.x/conf
   nano sonar.properties
   ```

   Key configurations you might want to adjust:
    
   ``` 
    Database Settings: sonar.jdbc.username, sonar.jdbc.password
    Web Port: sonar.web.port=9000 (change this if you need a different port)
   ```

Step 5: Start SonarQube Service

   * Navigate to the Linux binaries directory and start the SonarQube service:

   ```
   cd /opt/sonarqube-x.x/bin/linux-x86-64
   ./sonar.sh start
   ```

   * Note: If you attempt to start SonarQube as the root user, it will fail due to Elasticsearch restrictions.

   * If you encounter an error related to running SonarQube as the root user, refer to the next section to create a non-root user.

Step 6: Create Non-Root User and Start Service

   * To resolve the "cannot run Elasticsearch as root" error, create a non-root user and give it ownership of the SonarQube directory:

   ```
   sudo su -
   useradd sonaradmin
   chown -R sonaradmin:sonaradmin /opt/sonarqube
   
   # Switch to the newly created user and start SonarQube:
   ```
   ```
   sudo su - sonaradmin
   cd /opt/sonarqube/bin/linux-x86-64
   ./sonar.sh start
   ./sonar.sh status
   ```
   
Step 7: Open SonarQube Port in Security Group

   * Ensure that port 9000 is open in the EC2 instance's security group to allow access to the SonarQube web interface.

   ```
   sudo ufw allow 9000
   ```

Step 8: Access SonarQube in Browser

   * Once the service is running, you can access SonarQube via a web browser at,
 
   ```
   http://<Public-IP>:9000
   ```
### Secret Management

1. Jenkins Secret Management

Step 9: Generate SonarQube Auth Token in Jenkins for Jenkins Integration

   * To integrate SonarQube with Jenkins, follow these steps to generate a token in the SonarQube UI:

        
         1.1 Go to Administration > Security > Users.
         1.2 Click on Tokens and generate a new token.
         1.3 Save this token as it will be used to authenticate Jenkins with SonarQube for code quality analysis.

     * You will need this token when configuring SonarQube integration in Jenkins.

>> Note: For Jenkins secrets, use the [Jenkinsfile](../jenkins/Jenkinsfile): This file is configured to pull secrets directly from Jenkins' internal secret management system.

2. AWS Secrets Manager

Step 10: Store SonarQube Token in AWS Secrets Manager for Jenkins Integration

For enhanced security, you can store the SonarQube token in AWS Secrets Manager and configure Jenkins to retrieve it during pipeline execution. Follow these steps:

         10.1 Login to AWS Console
         10.2 Navigate to AWS Secrets Manager and click on Store a new secret.
         10.3 Choose Secret Type
         10.4 Select Other type of secrets.
         10.5 In the Key/Value pairs, add the following key-value:
        
         * SONAR_TOKEN: <paste your generated SonarQube token here>

         10.6 Set Secret Name

         * Name your secret (e.g., sonarqube-token).

         10.7 Configure Access, Create IAM Role and attach role to EC2 instance
    
         * Set the necessary permissions (IAM roles or policies) that allow Jenkins to access the secret.  

         * You will need this token when configuring SonarQube integration in Jenkins.

   >> Note: For AWS Secrets Manager, use the [Jenkinsfile.aws](../jenkins/Jenkinsfile.aws): This file is configured to fetch secrets from AWS Secrets Manager for secure access in the Jenkins pipeline.


# Jenkins Installation
  
Step 1: Install Jenkins

   * To install Jenkins on your EC2 instance (Ubuntu 22.04), run the following commands,

   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre -y
   
   sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
   https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key

   tar -xvzf <.....>
   mv <.......> maven
   ls
   ```

   * For maven we should set up 2 variables named "M2_HOME" and "M2". Setup M2_HOME and M2 paths in .bash_profile of the user and add these to the path variable

   ```
   vi ~/.bash_profile
   M2_HOME=/opt/maven/apache-maven-3.6.1
   M2=$M2_HOME/bin
   PATH=$PATH:$M2_HOME:$M2
   ```
Step 2: Access the Jenkins Web UI

   * Once Jenkins is installed, open a browser and access the Jenkins UI:

   ```
   http://<Public-IP>:8080
   ```
   * Enter the initial admin password, which can be found by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
   ```
